LocalKart is an e-commerce platform that provides customers with a convenient and easy way to purchase groceries, vegetables, dairy products, and household goods from local stores. The website operates using a commission model, where we charges a commission from partner stores for each order. They also offer a subscription model, where sellers can subscribe on a weekly or monthly basis to sell their products on the website. Delivery charges, based on the distance of delivery, and surge pricing, which applies during periods of high demand for a particular item, are two other ways LocalKart generates revenue. The platform is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and offers quality assurance for the products sold on the site.  I also have a plans to expand the platform in the future by developing a mobile application and adding additional services like urban company, app-based cab and bike aggregators, and courier services. This expansion is aimed at increasing customer convenience and attracting more users to the platform. Overall, LocalKart is a unique and innovative solution for shopping that makes the experience more convenient and enjoyable for customers.
